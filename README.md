WhisperBot is a Discord bot designed for the purpose of sending annonymous messages.

As a ttrpg player, WhisperBot was conceived as an effort to help create safe, 
comfortable spaces for everyone at the 'table'. If a player wishes to avoid a topic 
but does not feel comfortable breaking the flow of the game or speaking up physically,
or for any other reason, they can use WhisperBot to send a message to the DM/GM.

I will be continuing support and development on this project for the forseaable future, WhisperBot has just begun devlopment.

TODO:
-rework and simplify exisiting code
-add tags for prewritten messages
    ex: -ff 'fast-forward' tells the GM to 'fade to black' and skip the current scene
        -rw 'rewind' tells the GM to start the scene again and take a different route
-develop methods to prevent spam, abuse to other players/Discord users

-will possibly add random number generators and player statistics support, though that may be out of the scope of this project
